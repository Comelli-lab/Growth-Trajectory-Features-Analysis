Growth monitoring is essential for early diseasediagnosis in children and general health promotion throughoutlife.  However,  growth  pattern  detection  is  affected  by  themethod  applied.  Here  we  show  that  features  extracted  fromchildren  growth  trajectories  can  accurately  predict  growthpatterns and be used to explain and label them. We analyzedlongitudinal  body  mass  index-  ,  weight-  ,  and  length/height-for-age  z-scores  data  from  9577  children  from  2  cohorts,The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!) cohort(n=5492) and the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort (n=4085), basedin  Canada  and  Brazil,  respectively.  In  these  two  populations,we experimented with two different sets of features (CAnoni-cal Time-series Characteristics and trajectory features specificto  growth)  and  two  different  developmental  periods  (0-12years  and  0-50  months).  Features  predicted  the  identifiedgrowth patterns with more than 85% accuracy. In addition, asmall number of features (n=64) was sufficient to distinguishbetween  growth  patterns  across  childhood  in  both  cohorts.Features  offer  3  important  advantages:  objectivity,  simplicityand,  to  a  certain  degree,  predictability.  Our  approach  high-lights features as a tool to facilitate growth trajectory labelingand explainability.
